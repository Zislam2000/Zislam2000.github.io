                <p> 
                    The live show ticket market is making it increasingly difficult for the average fan to see their favorite artist in person. Individuals who do not manage to purchase a ticket at presale will be forced to succumb to the predatory practices of companies that buy up tickets and inflate the prices beyond what any reasonable person would pay. To combat this issue, Worldwide Coders plans to create a website that informs individuals of times and dates of presales for their favorite artists, giving the average consumer a chance to beat out companies. This should lower the financial barrier to entry and lead to a more accessible concert experience.
